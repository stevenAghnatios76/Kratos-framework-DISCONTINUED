# Kratos Framework v1.27.57

This project uses the **KRATOS** (Generative Agile Intelligence Architecture) framework — an AI agent framework for Claude Code that orchestrates software product development through 15 operational agents, 64 workflows, and 8 shared skills. KRATOS is the lightweight edition of [GAIA](https://github.com/jlouage/Gaia-framework) (25 agents) — optimized for fast, low-token-cost workflows. GitHub Copilot support is provided separately through `.github/copilot-instructions.md` because Copilot does not consume Claude slash-command frontmatter.

## How to Start

The primary entry point is `/kratos` — this activates the orchestrator (Kratos) who routes you to the right agent or workflow. When model selection matters, Kratos should hand off to the exact slash command so Claude Code applies that command's model frontmatter. You do not need to memorize all commands.

**5 essential commands:**
- `/kratos` — Start here. Kratos shows categories and routes you.
- `/kratos-dev-story` — Implement a user story
- `/kratos-quick-spec` — Rapid spec for small changes
- `/kratos-quick-dev` — Rapid implementation of a quick spec
- `/kratos-help` — Context-sensitive help

## Responding to `/kratos-*` Commands

When any `/kratos-*` command is invoked:
1. Load `{project-root}/_kratos/core/engine/workflow.xml` — this is the execution engine
2. The command file specifies a workflow.yaml or agent.md to process
3. If a workflow: prefer the pre-resolved config from `_kratos/{module}/.resolved/` when present; otherwise fall back to runtime resolution
4. Follow the engine instructions EXACTLY — the engine is the source of truth for step order, checkpoints, execution modes, and gates
5. Write a checkpoint to `_kratos/_memory/checkpoints/` after each significant step

**Artifact outputs:**
- `docs/planning-artifacts/` — PRDs, UX, architecture, epics
- `docs/implementation-artifacts/` — Sprint status, stories, changelogs
- `docs/test-artifacts/` — Test plans, traceability
- `docs/creative-artifacts/` — Design thinking, innovation outputs

## Global Rules (apply to ALL agents and workflows)

### Config Resolution
1. Check for pre-resolved config in `_kratos/{module}/.resolved/{workflow}.yaml`
2. If not found: load `workflow.yaml` → module `config.yaml` (which inherits `global.yaml`)
3. Resolve `{project-root}`, `{installed_path}`, system-generated values
4. After any config change, run `/kratos-build-configs` to regenerate resolved configs
5. Do not assume `.resolved/` exists in every checkout — fallback resolution must remain valid

### Context Budget
- **40K token max** for framework content per activation
- Never pre-load skills or knowledge fragments — load JIT when a step references them
- Use sectioned skill loading when only a subset of a skill is needed
- Release prior step content before loading the next step
- Agent persona files: max 200 lines
- Instruction step files: max 150 lines each
- Skill files: max 300 lines (or load individual sections at ~50 lines each)

### Markdown Size Limit
- Any `.md` file must stay at or under **1000 lines**
- If a markdown file would exceed 1000 lines, split it into multiple files before finalizing it
- Once the limit is crossed, create at least 2 markdown files and keep every resulting markdown file at or under 1000 lines
- Prefer structured sharding with an `index.md` and section-based files via `/kratos-shard-doc`

### Step Execution
- Keep this file brief and defer detailed execution behavior to `_kratos/core/engine/workflow.xml`
- Core invariants remain: execute steps in order, read full instruction files, save template outputs, and respect normal/YOLO/planning modes

### Checkpoint Discipline
- Write a checkpoint to `_kratos/_memory/checkpoints/` after each step completes
- Include workflow name, step number, key variables, output file path, and `files_touched` checksums
- On resume, validate checksums before continuing
- If context is lost, `/kratos-resume` recovers from the last checkpoint

### Quality Gates
- Gates are **enforced**, not advisory — workflow HALTS on gate failure
- Pre-start gates must pass before workflow execution begins
- Post-complete gates must pass before marking a workflow done
- Never mark a task complete without all tests passing

**Testing integration gates (enforced):**
- `create-epics-stories` requires `test-plan.md` — run `/kratos-test-design` after architecture
- `implementation-readiness` requires `traceability-matrix.md` + `ci-setup.md` — run `/kratos-trace` + `/kratos-ci-setup`
- `dev-story` requires `atdd-{story_key}.md` for high-risk stories — run `/kratos-atdd`
- `deployment-checklist` requires traceability + CI + readiness report PASS
- `brownfield-onboarding` requires NFR assessment + performance test plan (output to `test-artifacts/`)

### Sprint-Status Write Safety
- **Story file is source of truth** — sprint-status.yaml is a derived/cached view
- **Review workflows (6)** MUST NOT write to sprint-status.yaml — update only the story file
- **All other workflows** MUST re-read sprint-status.yaml immediately before writing
- Running `/kratos-sprint-status` reconciles sprint-status.yaml with story files

## Naming Conventions

- Slash commands: `kratos-{action}` for workflows, `kratos-agent-{name}` for agents
- Workflow dirs: `{phase}/{workflow-name}/`
- Workflow files: `workflow.yaml` + `instructions.xml` + `checklist.md` + optional `template.md`
- Agent files: `{agent-id}.md` with XML `<agent>` block
- Skill files: `{skill-name}.md` in `_kratos/dev/skills/`
- Knowledge fragments: `{topic}.md` in `_kratos/{module}/knowledge/{category}/`

## Developer Agent System

- 3 role-based senior developers extend `_kratos/dev/agents/_base-dev.md`
- Senior roles: frontend (Avery), backend (Rowan), fullstack (Jordan)
- 8 shared skills: git-workflow, api-design, database-design, docker-workflow, testing-patterns, code-review-standards, documentation-standards, security-basics
- Skills use sectioned loading — only the sections needed by the current step are loaded

## Sprint State Machine

```
backlog → validating → ready-for-dev → in-progress → blocked → review → done
```

**Review Gate:** A story in `review` requires ALL six reviews to pass before moving to `done`:
- `/kratos-code-review` — APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES
- `/kratos-qa-tests` — PASSED or FAILED
- `/kratos-security-review` — PASSED or FAILED
- `/kratos-test-automate` — PASSED or FAILED
- `/kratos-test-review` — PASSED or FAILED
- `/kratos-performance-review` — PASSED or FAILED

Run `/kratos-run-all-reviews` to execute all six reviews sequentially via subagents — one command instead of six.

If any review fails, the story remains in `review` until the failed reviews are fixed and re-run. The Review Gate table in the story file tracks progress.

## Memory Hygiene

Agent memory sidecars accumulate decisions across sessions. Run `/kratos-memory-hygiene` periodically (recommended before each sprint) to detect stale, contradicted, or orphaned entries by cross-referencing sidecar decisions against current planning and architecture artifacts.

## Do Not

- Pre-load files — load at runtime when needed
- Skip steps in a workflow — execute ALL steps in order
- Proceed past a template-output without user confirmation (unless YOLO mode)
- Modify files outside the workflow's declared output locations
- Commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Create agent files over 200 lines — delegate depth to skills and knowledge fragments
- Chase config inheritance chains at runtime — use pre-resolved configs
- Load more than 40K tokens of framework content in a single activation
