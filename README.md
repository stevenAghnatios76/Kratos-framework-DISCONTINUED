# GAIA — Generative Agile Intelligence Architecture

> **WARNING: This framework is currently in BETA. Workflows, commands, and APIs may change without notice. Use in production at your own risk.**

AI agent framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates software product development through 25 specialized agents, 62 workflows, and 8 shared skills — from initial research all the way to deployment.

GAIA gives you a team of AI agents with distinct personas, structured workflows that follow a proven product lifecycle, built-in quality gates, checkpoint/resume for long-running sessions, and persistent agent memory across conversations.

## Installation

### Using npx (recommended)

```bash
npx gaia-framework init .
```

This clones the latest GAIA release from GitHub and installs it into the current directory.

```bash
# Install into a new project
npx gaia-framework init ~/my-new-project

# Skip interactive prompts (uses defaults)
npx gaia-framework init --yes ~/my-project
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+ and git.

### Using the shell script directly

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/J-louage/Gaia-framework.git

# Install into your project
bash Gaia-framework/gaia-install.sh init ~/my-project

# Or use a local copy as source
bash gaia-install.sh init --source ~/Gaia-framework ~/my-project
```

The script resolves sources in this order: `--source` flag, `$GAIA_SOURCE` env var, script's own directory, GitHub clone.

### What the installer does

1. Copies the `_gaia/` framework into your project
2. Creates `docs/` artifact directories (planning, implementation, test, creative)
3. Creates memory sidecar directories with `.gitkeep` files
4. Creates `.resolved/` directories for pre-built configs
5. Prompts for project name and user name, writes them to `global.yaml`
6. Copies `CLAUDE.md` to your project root (the framework instruction file)
7. Installs 101 slash commands to `.claude/commands/`
8. Appends GAIA entries to `.gitignore`

### Updating an existing installation

```bash
# Via npx
npx gaia-framework update .

# Via shell script
bash gaia-install.sh update ~/my-project
```

Update refreshes all framework files (engine, agents, workflows, skills, knowledge, commands) while preserving your `global.yaml` configuration, agent memory, resolved configs, and `CLAUDE.md`.

Changed files are backed up to `_gaia/_backups/{timestamp}/` before overwriting.

### Validating and checking status

```bash
# Check installation integrity (32 checks)
npx gaia-framework validate .

# Show version, module list, command count, sidecar status
npx gaia-framework status .
```

### Installer options

```
gaia-install.sh <command> [options] [target]

Commands:
  init       Install GAIA into a project
  update     Update framework files (preserves config and memory)
  validate   Check installation integrity
  status     Show installation info

Options:
  --source <path>   Local GAIA source directory
  --yes             Skip confirmation prompts
  --dry-run         Show what would be done without making changes
  --verbose         Show detailed progress
  --help            Show help
```

---

## Getting Started

After installation, open your project in Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
claude
```

Then type `/gaia` to launch the orchestrator. Gaia presents a categorized menu and routes you to the right agent or workflow.

### 5 essential commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gaia` | Launch the orchestrator — shows categories and routes you |
| `/gaia-dev-story` | Implement a user story end-to-end |
| `/gaia-quick-spec` | Create a rapid tech spec for small changes |
| `/gaia-quick-dev` | Implement a quick spec |
| `/gaia-help` | Context-sensitive help for wherever you are |

### First-time setup

After installing GAIA into your project, run `/gaia-build-configs` to generate pre-resolved configuration files. This speeds up every future workflow activation by eliminating runtime config resolution.

### Anytime Workflows

Available at any point in the lifecycle.

| Command | Workflow | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/gaia-brownfield` | Brownfield Onboarding | 9-step knowledge base for existing projects — APIs, UX, events, dependencies, NFRs, architecture, stories |
| `/gaia-document-project` | Document Project | Document a project for AI context |
| `/gaia-project-context` | Generate Project Context | Generate context for AI consumption |
| `/gaia-performance-review` | Performance Review | Analyze performance bottlenecks |
| `/gaia-brainstorming` | Brainstorming | Facilitated brainstorming session |
| `/gaia-party` | Party Mode | Multi-agent group discussion |
| `/gaia-advanced-elicitation` | Advanced Elicitation | Deep requirements elicitation |

### Brownfield Onboarding (Deep Dive)

The brownfield onboarding workflow (`/gaia-brownfield`) is a comprehensive 9-step process that transforms an existing codebase into a fully documented developer knowledge base. It detects project capabilities during scanning and conditionally generates specialized documentation.

**Step 1 — Deep Project Discovery** scans the codebase and sets capability flags:

| Flag | Detection |
|------|-----------|
| `{has_apis}` | Route definitions, controllers, OpenAPI/Swagger specs |
| `{has_events}` | Kafka, RabbitMQ, SNS-SQS, Redis pub-sub, NATS patterns |
| `{has_external_deps}` | Outbound HTTP clients, SDKs, service URLs |
| `{has_frontend}` | React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, SwiftUI, CSS frameworks |

**Steps 2–4** are conditional — they only run when the corresponding capability is detected:

| Step | Condition | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2. API Documentation | `{has_apis}` | OpenAPI 3.x spec (discovered or generated), endpoint inventory, Mermaid flow diagram |
| 3. UX Design Assessment | `{has_frontend}` | UI patterns, Mermaid navigation sitemap, accessibility assessment, UX gaps |
| 4. Event & Messaging Catalog | `{has_events}` | Producer/consumer tables, delivery guarantees, Mermaid event flow diagrams |

**Steps 5–10** always run:

| Step | Output |
|------|--------|
| 5. Dependency Map | External services, infrastructure, library deps with CVE risk, Mermaid dependency graph |
| 6. NFR Assessment & Baselines | Code quality, security posture, performance, test coverage — output to `test-artifacts/nfr-assessment.md` (canonical) |
| 7. Performance Test Plan | Performance budgets, load test scenarios, Core Web Vitals targets — output to `test-artifacts/` (**REQUIRED**) |
| 8. Create PRD for Gaps | Gap-focused PRD with NFR baselines from step 6, references all upstream artifacts |
| 9. Map Architecture with Diagrams | C4 Mermaid diagrams (Level 1 + 2), 3–5 sequence diagrams, as-is/target delta |
| 10. Epics/Stories & Onboard Developer | Gap stories + developer knowledge base index linking all artifacts |

**Design rules:**
- All diagrams use **Mermaid syntax** — no ASCII art
- All API docs use **Swagger/OpenAPI format**
- Flow diagrams limited to **3–5 key flows** per document
- NFR baselines are **measured from the codebase**, not estimated

**Output artifacts** (up to 11, depending on detected capabilities):

| Artifact | Location | Always | Conditional |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `project-documentation.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `api-documentation.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | — | `{has_apis}` |
| `ux-design.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | — | `{has_frontend}` |
| `event-catalog.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | — | `{has_events}` |
| `dependency-map.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `nfr-assessment.md` | `test-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `performance-test-plan-{date}.md` | `test-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `prd.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `architecture.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `epics-and-stories.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |
| `brownfield-onboarding.md` | `planning-artifacts/` | Yes | — |

## Review & Utility Tasks

Standalone tasks that can be run anytime without a full workflow. These are single-step operations for reviews, audits, and document utilities.

### Code & Security Reviews

| Command | Task | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/gaia-adversarial` | Adversarial Review | Cynical critical review — finds weaknesses |
| `/gaia-edge-cases` | Edge Case Hunter | Identify edge cases and boundary conditions |
| `/gaia-review-security` | Security Review | OWASP-focused security review |
| `/gaia-review-api` | API Design Review | Review REST API against standards |
| `/gaia-review-deps` | Dependency Audit | Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities |
| `/gaia-review-a11y` | Accessibility Review | WCAG 2.1 compliance review |
| `/gaia-review-perf` | Performance Review | Code-level performance review |

### Adversarial Review (`/gaia-adversarial`)

The adversarial review is a cynical, critical examination designed to find flaws, gaps, and weaknesses in any document or design. It deliberately assumes nothing works as claimed and attacks from **10 different perspectives**:

| Perspective | What it challenges |
|---|---|
| **Feasibility** | Can this actually be built as described? |
| **Completeness** | What's missing that should be there? |
| **Contradictions** | Do any sections contradict each other? |
| **Assumptions** | What unstated assumptions could be wrong? |
| **Scale** | Will this work at 10x/100x expected load? |
| **Failure modes** | What happens when things go wrong? |
| **Dependencies** | What external factors could break this? |
| **Security** | What attack surfaces are exposed? |
| **User impact** | Where will users get confused or frustrated? |
| **Business risk** | What could make this commercially unviable? |

**Output:** A ranked findings report with severity (critical/high/medium/low), confidence (certain/likely/possible), a threat summary of the top 3 issues, and an overall risk assessment. The review only identifies problems — it does not suggest fixes.

**When to use it:** The adversarial review is integrated as an optional prompt at 4 key lifecycle points:

| Trigger Point | When Prompted | Recommended For |
|---|---|---|
| After `/gaia-create-prd` | End of PRD creation (step 11) | Complex or high-stakes products |
| After `/gaia-create-arch` | End of architecture design (step 9) | Distributed systems, high-scale projects |
| After `/gaia-create-epics` | End of epic/story creation (step 8) | Before sprint planning |
| After `/gaia-readiness-check` | End of readiness check (step 9) | Strongly recommended — last chance before build |

At each point you can accept or skip. It can also be run independently anytime with `/gaia-adversarial` on any artifact.

### Lifecycle-Integrated Reviews

In addition to the adversarial review, several other tasks are integrated into the lifecycle at natural trigger points:

**Review Gate members** (required — story cannot move to `done` without all 6 passing):

| Review Command | Gate Row | Verdict | What It Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/gaia-code-review` | Code Review | APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES | Correctness, security, performance, readability |
| `/gaia-qa-tests` | QA Tests | PASSED / FAILED | E2E and API test generation + execution |
| `/gaia-security-review` | Security Review | PASSED / FAILED | OWASP Top 10, secrets, auth patterns |
| `/gaia-test-automate` | Test Automation | PASSED / FAILED | Coverage gaps, uncovered code paths |
| `/gaia-test-review` | Test Review | PASSED / FAILED | Test quality, flakiness, isolation, determinism |
| `/gaia-review-perf` | Performance Review | PASSED / FAILED | N+1 queries, memory, bundle size, caching, complexity. Auto-passes if no performance-relevant code changes |

**Optional prompts** (offered at natural lifecycle points — user can accept or skip):

| Review Command | Trigger Point | When Prompted | Recommended For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/gaia-review-api` | After `/gaia-create-arch` | End of architecture design (step 9) | Projects with REST APIs |
| `/gaia-review-a11y` | After `/gaia-create-ux` | End of UX design (step 8) | User-facing applications |
| `/gaia-edge-cases` | After `/gaia-create-epics` | End of epic/story creation (step 8) | Before sprint planning |
| `/gaia-review-deps` | During `/gaia-brownfield` | After dependency map (step 5) | Brownfield projects |
| `/gaia-review-perf` | Review Gate member | Required (auto-passes if no perf-relevant changes) | See Review Gate members table above |
| `/gaia-a11y-testing` | During `/gaia-deploy-checklist` | After loading context (step 2) | Frontend/user-facing applications |
| `/gaia-mobile-testing` | During `/gaia-sprint-plan` | After story selection (step 4) | Mobile/responsive applications |

All reviews can also be run independently anytime on any artifact or codebase.

## Templates

Document templates in `_gaia/lifecycle/templates/` provide standardized structures for workflow outputs. Each template has YAML frontmatter (`template`, `version`, `used_by`) and placeholder sections that agents fill during execution.

| Template | Used By | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `prd-template.md` | create-prd | Product requirements document |
| `architecture-template.md` | create-architecture | Greenfield architecture document |
| `brownfield-architecture-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | As-is/target architecture with Mermaid C4 diagrams |
| `story-template.md` | create-epics-stories | User story with acceptance criteria |
| `sprint-plan-template.md` | sprint-planning | Sprint plan with capacity and goals |
| `product-brief-template.md` | create-product-brief | Product brief for stakeholder alignment |
| `review-template.md` | code-review | Code review report |
| `test-plan-template.md` | test-design | Test plan with strategy and coverage |
| `deployment-template.md` | release-plan | Deployment plan and checklist |
| `api-documentation-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | OpenAPI/Swagger API documentation |
| `event-catalog-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | Event producer/consumer catalog |
| `dependency-map-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | Service, infrastructure, and library dependencies |
| `nfr-assessment-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | Non-functional requirements baselines |
| `ux-design-assessment-template.md` | brownfield-onboarding | UI patterns and accessibility assessment |
| `epic-status-template.md` | epic-status | Epic completion dashboard with progress bars |

## Checkpoint & Resume

Long-running workflows save checkpoints to `_gaia/_memory/checkpoints/`. If your session is interrupted or context is lost, run `/gaia-resume` to pick up from the last completed step.

Completed workflow checkpoints move to `_gaia/_memory/checkpoints/completed/`.

---

## Agent Memory

Each agent has a persistent memory sidecar that survives across sessions:

```
_gaia/_memory/
├── architect-sidecar/
├── devops-sidecar/
├── orchestrator-sidecar/
├── pm-sidecar/
├── security-sidecar/
├── sm-sidecar/
├── storyteller-sidecar/
├── tech-writer-sidecar/
└── test-architect-sidecar/
```

Agents store decisions, patterns, and context they learn about your project. This memory accumulates over time, making agents more effective the more you use them.

---

## Configuration

### global.yaml

The single source of truth for project settings at `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`:

```yaml
framework_name: "GAIA"
framework_version: "1.13.0"

user_name: "your-name"
project_name: "your-project"
project_root: "{project-root}"

output_folder: "{project-root}/docs"
planning_artifacts: "{project-root}/docs/planning-artifacts"
implementation_artifacts: "{project-root}/docs/implementation-artifacts"
test_artifacts: "{project-root}/docs/test-artifacts"
creative_artifacts: "{project-root}/docs/creative-artifacts"
```

The `{project-root}` placeholder is resolved at runtime. After changing `global.yaml`, run `/gaia-build-configs` to regenerate resolved configs.

### Pre-resolved configs

Each module (core, lifecycle, creative, testing) has a `.resolved/` directory for pre-built config files. These eliminate runtime config resolution overhead. Generate them with `/gaia-build-configs`.

---

## Teams

Pre-built team compositions for different project types:

| Team | Focus | Agents |
|------|-------|--------|
| Full | Complete coverage | All lifecycle + dev agents |
| Planning | Requirements & design | Analyst, PM, UX Designer, Architect |
| Implementation | Build & ship | SM, dev agents, QA, DevOps |
| Quick Ship | Minimal ceremony | PM, dev agent, QA |
| Enterprise | Governance-heavy | Full team + Security, Performance |
| Security-Focused | Security-first | Architect, Security, DevOps, QA |
| Data-Intensive | Data pipelines | Architect, Data Engineer, Python Dev |

/gaia-brownfield           → deep project discovery (10 steps)
                              1. Scan codebase → project-documentation.md
                              2. API documentation (if APIs detected)
                              3. UX assessment (if frontend detected)
                              4. Event catalog (if messaging detected)
                              5. Dependency map
