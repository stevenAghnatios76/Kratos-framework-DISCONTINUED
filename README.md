AI agent framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates software product development through **25 specialized agents**, **64 workflows**, and **8 shared skills** — from initial research all the way to deployment.

### Why GAIA?

Using Claude Code alone, you prompt an AI assistant. With GAIA, you manage a **team of AI specialists** that follow a proven product lifecycle:

- **Structured lifecycle** — 5 phases from analysis to deployment, with quality gates that enforce standards at every transition
- **25 specialized agents** — each with a persona, domain expertise, and persistent memory that improves over time
- **Built-in quality gates** — 17 enforced gates that HALT workflows when standards aren't met (not advisory — hard stops)
- **6-gate review process** — every story passes code review, QA, security, test automation, test review, and performance review before completion
- **Checkpoint/resume** — long-running workflows survive context loss with sha256-verified checkpoints
- **Brownfield support** — onboard existing codebases with automated discovery, documentation generation, and gap analysis

---

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (requires Anthropic account)
- Node.js 18+
- Git

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install GAIA into your project
npx gaia-framework init ~/my-project

# Open in Claude Code
cd ~/my-project && claude

# Generate pre-resolved configs (one-time setup)
/gaia-build-configs
```

Then try your first workflow:

```bash
# Describe a small feature and get a tech spec in 30 seconds
/gaia-quick-spec

# Implement it immediately
/gaia-quick-dev
```

Or launch the orchestrator to explore all capabilities:

```bash
/gaia
```

### 5 essential commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gaia` | Launch the orchestrator — shows categories and routes you |
| `/gaia-dev-story` | Implement a user story end-to-end |
| `/gaia-quick-spec` | Create a rapid tech spec for small changes |
| `/gaia-quick-dev` | Implement a quick spec |
| `/gaia-help` | Context-sensitive help for wherever you are |

---

## Installation

### Using npx (recommended)

```bash
npx gaia-framework init .
```

```bash
# Install into a specific directory
npx gaia-framework init ~/my-new-project

# Skip interactive prompts
npx gaia-framework init --yes ~/my-project
```

### Using the shell script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlouage/Gaia-framework.git
bash Gaia-framework/gaia-install.sh init ~/my-project
```

### What the installer does

1. Copies the `_gaia/` framework into your project
2. Creates `docs/` artifact directories (planning, implementation, test, creative)
3. Creates memory sidecar directories
4. Prompts for project name and user name → writes to `global.yaml`
5. Copies `CLAUDE.md` to your project root
6. Installs 104 slash commands to `.claude/commands/`
7. Appends GAIA entries to `.gitignore`

### Updating

```bash
npx gaia-framework update .
```

Update refreshes all framework files while preserving your configuration, agent memory, and `CLAUDE.md`. Changed files are backed up to `_gaia/_backups/{timestamp}/`.

### Validating

```bash
npx gaia-framework validate .   # 32 integrity checks
npx gaia-framework status .     # version, module list, command count
```

---

## How It Works

### 5-phase product lifecycle

```
Phase 1: Analysis → Phase 2: Planning → Phase 3: Solutioning → Phase 4: Implementation → Phase 5: Deployment
   (Elena)           (Derek/Christy)      (Theo/Zara/Soren)      (Nate/Dev Agents)        (Soren)
```

Every phase has **quality gates** — enforced checks that halt the workflow if prerequisites aren't met. You can't create an architecture without a reviewed PRD. You can't start a sprint without a readiness check. You can't deploy without passing all reviews.

### Entry points

| Path | Command | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| New project | Start at Phase 1 | Greenfield — building from scratch |
| Existing project | `/gaia-brownfield` | Brownfield — onboarding existing codebase |
| Small change | `/gaia-quick-spec` | Under 5 files, under 1 day |
| Resume | `/gaia-resume` | Continue after context loss |

### Model assignment

Each command declares which Claude model to use. **Opus** handles deep reasoning, architectural decisions, and complex analysis (27 commands). **Sonnet** handles structured generation, template-following, and status reporting (77 commands). Claude Code auto-selects the model per workflow.

### Execution modes

Workflows support three modes: **normal** (pauses for confirmation at each checkpoint), **YOLO** (auto-proceeds without pausing), and **planning** (presents a structured execution plan for approval before any steps run). You can switch between normal and YOLO mid-workflow.

---

## Agents

Every agent has a name, persona, and specialization. Activate any agent directly with `/gaia-agent-{name}` or let the orchestrator route you.

## Typical Workflow

### Greenfield — new project from idea to deployment

```
# Phase 1: Analysis
/gaia-brainstorm             → brainstorm the idea
/gaia-product-brief          → create a product brief

# Phase 2: Planning
/gaia-create-prd             → write the PRD
/gaia-create-ux              → design the UX

# Phase 3: Solutioning
/gaia-create-arch            → design the architecture
/gaia-test-design            → create test plan
/gaia-create-epics           → break into epics and stories
/gaia-trace                  → generate traceability matrix
/gaia-ci-setup               → scaffold CI pipeline
/gaia-readiness-check        → verify everything is ready

# Phase 4: Implementation (repeat per sprint)
/gaia-sprint-plan            → plan the sprint
/gaia-dev-story              → implement stories
/gaia-run-all-reviews        → run all 6 review gates
/gaia-retro                  → sprint retrospective

# Phase 5: Deployment
/gaia-deploy-checklist       → pre-deploy verification
/gaia-post-deploy            → post-deploy health check
```

For **brownfield projects** (existing codebases), start with `/gaia-brownfield` — a 6-step orchestration that scans your codebase, generates documentation (APIs, UX, events, dependencies, NFR baselines), creates a gap-focused PRD, and maps the architecture. Then continue from Phase 3 above.

### At a glance

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Agents | 25 with distinct personas |
| Workflows | 64 across 5 lifecycle phases |
| Standalone tasks | 15 (reviews, audits, utilities) |
| Slash commands | 104 |
| Shared skills | 8 with 47 loadable sections |
| Knowledge fragments | 45 |
| Document templates | 18 |
| Quality gates | 17 (enforced, not advisory) |

---

## Configuration

The single source of truth is `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`:

```yaml
framework_name: "GAIA"
framework_version: "1.27.38"
user_name: "your-name"
project_name: "your-project"
```

After changing `global.yaml`, run `/gaia-build-configs` to regenerate pre-resolved configs. Each module has a `.resolved/` directory that eliminates runtime config resolution overhead.

---

## Checkpoint & Resume

Long-running workflows save checkpoints to `_gaia/_memory/checkpoints/` with sha256 checksums of all files touched. If your session is interrupted, run `/gaia-resume` — it validates file integrity before resuming from the last completed step.

---

## Agent Memory

Each agent has a persistent memory sidecar (`_gaia/_memory/*-sidecar/`) that stores decisions, patterns, and context across sessions. Agents become more effective the more you use them. Run `/gaia-memory-hygiene` periodically to detect stale or contradicted decisions.

---

## Limitations

- **Single-user only** — GAIA uses markdown files for state management (stories, sprint status, architecture docs). Multiple team members editing the same project will run into file conflicts.
- **Claude Code required** — GAIA is built specifically for Claude Code and cannot run on other AI coding assistants.
- **Context budget** — Complex workflows can consume significant context. The framework enforces a 40K token budget per activation with just-in-time loading to manage this, but very large projects may hit limits.
